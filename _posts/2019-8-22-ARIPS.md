title: ARIPS robot
---

This is ARIPS, a mobile robot platform equipped with a 2-wheel differential drive, a kinect, a LIDAR, and a custom 3D printed robot arm.

ARIPS can drive around, create maps of its environment, and autonomously navigate to any specified location while avoiding obstacles. Using its arm, it can grab and carry small pieces. The robot is mainly controlled by a 13' laptop running [ROS](wiki.ros.org). The software for running the robot can be found at [https://github.com/jgdo/arips_ros](https://github.com/jgdo/arips_ros).

## Hardware specs

The general design of ARIPS is based on the [Original TurtleBot](https://www.turtlebot.com/), being a good trade-off between size, mobility, costs, and space for electronics/equipment. The round shape allows the robot to rotate in place at any location without having to worry about potential collisions. Also it simplifies navigation, since there is no need to consider the current orientation when checking for collision.

Originally I actually used a salvaged base of a broken cheap robotic vacuum cleaner, but then quickly moved to the RD02 robot drive kit, due to repeating problems with odometry sensors and underpowered motors. 

### Sensors
- Original Xbox 360 Kinect
- [YDLIDAR X4](http://ydlidar.com/product/X4)
- Motor hall sensors for odometry

### Drive

ARIPS uses the "RD02 Robot Drive System" available in many online stores. It consists of two geared motors with hall sensors and the [MD25](https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/md25tech.htm) controller board with an I2C and UART interface. The motor driver is connected to the main Laptop through a USB-serial converter.
